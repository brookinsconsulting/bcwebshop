BC Web Shop USAGE

Usage
============

1. Running the extension
   ========================

The first thing you should do once installed is review your website templates use of the eZ Publish Webshop System and change any paths to content/action to shop/action as this has been refactored recently.

The package works by default replacing the kernel's shop module with the one provided in this extension.
